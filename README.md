# Python Practice Overview

This project contains small Python programs demonstrating basic concepts:

1. **Palindrome Checker**  
   - Checks if a string (from user input) is a palindrome.

2. **List Comprehension - Squares**  
   - Generates a list of squares from a given list of numbers.

3. **Students DataFrame**  
   - Creates a DataFrame of 5 students with marks.  
   - Finds and displays students who scored more than 80.

4. **Random 5x5 NumPy Array**  
   - Generates a 5x5 array with random integers between 1 and 100.

5. **Products DataFrame**  
   - Creates a DataFrame with product details (`Product Name`, `Price`, `Category`).  
   - Adds a `Discounted Price` column (90% of original).  
   - Filters and displays products cheaper than 500.
